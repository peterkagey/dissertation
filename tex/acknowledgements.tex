To my advisor, Sami Assaf---thank you not just for your support and
excitement about even my most eclectic mathematical interests,
but also for your friendship, encouragement, and generosity
since even before I was a fledgling graduate student.

To my committee member, Richard Arratia---for your great taste
in problems and your surprising, and fun conversations. I'm going to miss having
you work across the hall from me. (I'm also going to miss your prize money.)

To my committee member, David Kempe---I knew of you before I knew you, and it's been
such a blessing having your thoughtfulness and interest throughout this process.
Every interaction with you has been a gem.

I would like to thank all of my friends and colleagues,
especially those who encouraged me to spend ever increasing time in KAP 500.

Finally, Sierra---I know I'm a broken record, but getting to spend half of a
decade with you in graduate school has been the blessing of a lifetime.
You make the world a richer place, and I couldn't be more thankful to have you
in my corner.
I can't wait to see what the rest of our lives have in store together!
