This dissertation considers four distinct problems.
The first topic is motivated by generalizing a puzzles called
``Spinning Switches''. It looks at a two-player games on a finite wreath
products, and classifies several families of wreath products where
the first player has a winning strategy and several families where the
second player has a winning strategy, including a complete classification
for when the base of the wreath product is abelian.
The second topic attempts to understand a correspondence between
$k$-cycles in permutations and derangements of the generalized symmetric
group. In this chapter, we also develop a novel insertion algorithm that
preserves the number of $k$-cycles in the image whenever possible.
The third topic is a ``proof without words'' that illustrates a bijection
between equilateral triangles on the triangular grid and four-element subsets
of integers.
The fourth topic looks at efficient ways to compute the $i$-th permutation
in for ordered lists of both derangements and m\'enage permutations. Here
we use rook theory to compute the number of such permutations with given
prefixes, and use these computations to unrank these sets.
